### What I learned


```html
<!-- Semantic HTML structure for better accessibility -->
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
</ul>

```
```css
/* Organized sections with subtle borders */
.ingredients,
.instructions {
  border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
}

```
- Improved handling of lists (ul, ol) for recipe steps.

- Better use of Google Fonts for typography.

- Practiced responsive design with media queries.
